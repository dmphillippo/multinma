\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{stan_nma} object created by \code{\link[=nma]{nma()}}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments, passed to \code{\link[=uniroot]{uniroot()}} for regression models
if \code{baseline_level = "aggregate"}.}

\item{baseline}{An optional \code{\link[=distr]{distr()}} distribution for the baseline response
(i.e. intercept), about which to produce absolute effects. Can also be a
character string naming a study in the network to take the estimated
baseline response distribution from. If \code{NULL}, predictions are produced
using the baseline response for each study in the network with IPD or
arm-based AgD.

For regression models, this may be a list of \code{\link[=distr]{distr()}} distributions (or
study names in the network to use the baseline distributions from) of the
same length as the number of studies in \code{newdata}, possibly named by the
studies in \code{newdata} or otherwise in order of appearance in \code{newdata}.

Use the \code{baseline_type} and \code{baseline_level} arguments to specify whether
this distribution is on the response or linear predictor scale, and (for
ML-NMR or models including IPD) whether this applies to an individual at
the reference level of the covariates or over the entire \code{newdata}
population, respectively. For example, in a model with a logit link with
\code{baseline_type = "link"}, this would be a distribution for the baseline log
odds of an event. For survival models, \code{baseline} always corresponds to the
intercept parameters in the linear predictor (i.e. \code{baseline_type} is
always \code{"link"}, and \code{baseline_level} is \code{"individual"} for IPD NMA or
ML-NMR, and \code{"aggregate"} for AgD NMA).

Use the \code{baseline_trt} argument to specify which treatment this
distribution applies to.}

\item{newdata}{Only required if a regression model is fitted and \code{baseline}
is specified. A data frame of covariate details, for which to produce
predictions. Column names must match variables in the regression model.

If \code{level = "aggregate"} this should either be a data frame with integration
points as produced by \code{\link[=add_integration]{add_integration()}} (one row per study), or a data
frame with individual covariate values (one row per individual) which are
summarised over.

If \code{level = "individual"} this should be a data frame of individual
covariate values, one row per individual.

If \code{NULL}, predictions are produced for all studies with IPD and/or
arm-based AgD in the network, depending on the value of \code{level}.}

\item{study}{Column of \code{newdata} which specifies study names or IDs. When not
specified: if \code{newdata} contains integration points produced by
\code{\link[=add_integration]{add_integration()}}, studies will be labelled sequentially by row;
otherwise data will be assumed to come from a single study.}

\item{type}{Whether to produce predictions on the \code{"link"} scale (the
default, e.g. log odds) or \code{"response"} scale (e.g. probabilities).

For survival models, the options are \code{"survival"} for survival
probabilities (the default), \code{"hazard"} for hazards, \code{"cumhaz"} for
cumulative hazards, \code{"mean"} for mean survival times, \code{"quantile"} for
quantiles of the survival time distribution, \code{"median"} for median survival
times (equivalent to \code{type = "quantile"} with \code{quantiles = 0.5}), \code{"rmst"}
for restricted mean survival times, or \code{"link"} for the linear predictor.
For \code{type = "survival"}, \code{"hazard"} or \code{"cumhaz"}, predictions are given at
the times specified by \code{times} or at the event/censoring times in the
network if \code{times = NULL}. For \code{type = "rmst"}, the restricted time horizon
is specified by \code{times}, or if \code{times = NULL} the earliest last follow-up
time amongst the studies in the network is used. When \code{level = "aggregate"}, these all correspond to the standardised survival function
(see details).}

\item{level}{The level at which predictions are produced, either
\code{"aggregate"} (the default), or \code{"individual"}. If \code{baseline} is not
specified, predictions are produced for all IPD studies in the network if
\code{level} is \code{"individual"} or \code{"aggregate"}, and for all arm-based AgD
studies in the network if \code{level} is \code{"aggregate"}.}

\item{baseline_trt}{Treatment to which the \code{baseline} response distribution
refers, if \code{baseline} is specified. By default, the baseline response
distribution will refer to the network reference treatment. Coerced to
character string.}

\item{baseline_type}{When a \code{baseline} distribution is given, specifies
whether this corresponds to the \code{"link"} scale (the default, e.g. log odds)
or \code{"response"} scale (e.g. probabilities). For survival models, \code{baseline}
always corresponds to the intercept parameters in the linear predictor
(i.e. \code{baseline_type} is always \code{"link"}).}

\item{baseline_level}{When a \code{baseline} distribution is given, specifies
whether this corresponds to an individual at the reference level of the
covariates (\code{"individual"}, the default), or from an (unadjusted) average
outcome on the reference treatment in the \code{newdata} population
(\code{"aggregate"}). Ignored for AgD NMA, since the only option is
\code{"aggregate"} in this instance. For survival models, \code{baseline} always
corresponds to the intercept parameters in the linear predictor (i.e.
\code{baseline_level} is \code{"individual"} for IPD NMA or ML-NMR, and \code{"aggregate"}
for AgD NMA).}

\item{probs}{Numeric vector of quantiles of interest to present in computed
summary, default \code{c(0.025, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.975)}}

\item{predictive_distribution}{Logical, when a random effects model has been
fitted, should the predictive distribution for absolute effects in a new
study be returned? Default \code{FALSE}.}

\item{summary}{Logical, calculate posterior summaries? Default \code{TRUE}.}

\item{progress}{Logical, display progress for potentially long-running
calculations? Population-average predictions from ML-NMR models are
computationally intensive, especially for survival outcomes. Currently the
default is to display progress only when running interactively and
producing predictions for a survival ML-NMR model.}

\item{trt_ref}{Deprecated, use \code{baseline_trt} instead.}

\item{times}{A numeric vector of times to evaluate predictions at.
Alternatively, if \code{newdata} is specified, \code{times} can be the name of a
column in \code{newdata} which contains the times. If \code{NULL} (the default) then
predictions are made at the event/censoring times from the studies included
in the network (or according to \code{times_seq}). Only used if \code{type} is
\code{"survival"}, \code{"hazard"}, \code{"cumhaz"} or \code{"rmst"}.}

\item{aux}{An optional \code{\link[=distr]{distr()}} distribution for the auxiliary parameter(s)
in the baseline hazard (e.g. shapes). Can also be a character string naming
a study in the network to take the estimated auxiliary parameter
distribution from. If \code{NULL}, predictions are produced using the parameter
estimates for each study in the network with IPD or arm-based AgD.

For regression models, this may be a list of \code{\link[=distr]{distr()}} distributions (or
study names in the network to use the auxiliary parameters from) of the
same length as the number of studies in \code{newdata}, possibly named by the
study names or otherwise in order of appearance in \code{newdata}.}

\item{quantiles}{A numeric vector of quantiles of the survival time
distribution to produce estimates for when \code{type = "quantile"}.}

\item{times_seq}{A positive integer, when specified evaluate predictions at
this many evenly-spaced event times between 0 and the latest follow-up time
in each study, instead of every observed event/censoring time. Only used if
\code{newdata = NULL} and \code{type} is \code{"survival"}, \code{"hazard"} or \code{"cumhaz"}. This
can be useful for plotting survival or (cumulative) hazard curves, where
prediction at every observed even/censoring time is unnecessary and can be
slow. When a call from within \code{plot()} is detected, e.g. like
\code{plot(predict(fit, type = "survival"))}, \code{times_seq} will default to 50.}

A \link{nma_summary} object if \code{summary = TRUE}, otherwise a list

\description{
Obtain predictions of absolute effects from NMA models fitted with \code{\link[=nma]{nma()}}.
For example, if a model is fitted to binary data with a logit link, predicted
outcome probabilities or log odds can be produced. For survival models,
predictions can be made for survival probabilities, (cumulative) hazards,
(restricted) mean survival times, and quantiles including median survival
times.
When an IPD NMA or ML-NMR model has been fitted, predictions can be
produced either at an individual level or at an aggregate level.
Aggregate-level predictions are population-average absolute effects; these
are marginalised or standardised over a population. For example, average
event probabilities from a logistic regression, or marginal (standardised)
survival probabilities from a survival model.
}
\section{Aggregate-level predictions from IPD NMA and ML-NMR models}{
Population-average absolute effects can be produced from IPD NMA and ML-NMR
models with \code{level = "aggregate"}. Predictions are averaged over the target
population (i.e. standardised/marginalised), either by (numerical)
integration over the joint covariate distribution (for AgD studies in the
network for ML-NMR, or AgD \code{newdata} with integration points created by
\code{\link[=add_integration]{add_integration()}}), or by averaging predictions for a sample of individuals
(for IPD studies in the network for IPD NMA/ML-NMR, or IPD \code{newdata}).

For example, with a binary outcome, the population-average event
probabilities on treatment \eqn{k} in study/population \eqn{j} are
\deqn{\bar{p}_{jk} = \int_\mathfrak{X} p_{jk}(\mathbf{x}) f_{jk}(\mathbf{x})
d\mathbf{x}}
for a joint covariate distribution \eqn{f_{jk}(\mathbf{x})} with
support \eqn{\mathfrak{X}} or
\deqn{\bar{p}_{jk} = \sum_i p_{jk}(\mathbf{x}_i)}
for a sample of individuals with covariates \eqn{\mathbf{x}_i}.

Population-average absolute predictions follow similarly for other types of
outcomes, however for survival outcomes there are specific considerations.
\subsection{Standardised survival predictions}{

Different types of population-average survival predictions, often called
standardised survival predictions, follow from the \strong{standardised survival
function} created by integrating (or equivalently averaging) the
individual-level survival functions at each time \eqn{t}:
\deqn{\bar{S}_{jk}(t) = \int_\mathfrak{X} S_{jk}(t | \mathbf{x}) f_{jk}(\mathbf{x})
d\mathbf{x}}
which is itself produced using \code{type = "survival"}.

The \strong{standardised hazard function} corresponding to this standardised
survival function is a weighted average of the individual-level hazard
functions
\deqn{\bar{h}_{jk}(t) = \frac{\int_\mathfrak{X} S_{jk}(t | \mathbf{x}) h_{jk}(t | \mathbf{x}) f_{jk}(\mathbf{x})
d\mathbf{x} }{\bar{S}_{jk}(t)}}
weighted by the probability of surviving to time \eqn{t}. This is produced
using \code{type = "hazard"}.

The corresponding \strong{standardised cumulative hazard function} is
\deqn{\bar{H}_{jk}(t) = -\log(\bar{S}_{jk}(t))}
and is produced using \code{type = "cumhaz"}.

\strong{Quantiles and medians} of the standardised survival times are found by
solving
\deqn{\bar{S}_{jk}(t) = 1-\alpha}
for the \eqn{\alpha\%} quantile, using numerical root finding. These are
produced using \code{type = "quantile"} or \code{"median"}.

\strong{(Restricted) means} of the standardised survival times are found by
integrating
\deqn{\mathrm{RMST}_{jk}(t^*) = \int_0^{t^*} \bar{S}_{jk}(t) dt}
up to the restricted time horizon \eqn{t^*}, with \eqn{t^*=\infty} for mean
standardised survival time. These are produced using \code{type = "rmst"} or
\code{"mean"}.
