@Leahy2019 present a network of five trials comparing lenalidomide and thalidomide to placebo for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) after autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).
The outcome of interest is progression free survival (PFS).
Simulated individual patient data (IPD) from three trials are found in the data set `ndmm_ipd`.
These include outcome times, censoring indicators, and covariates for each individual:
```{r}
head(ndmm_ipd)
```

Aggregate data (AgD) consisting of reconstructed event/censoring times from digitized Kaplan-Meier curves and covariate summaries are available on a further two trials, found in the data sets `ndmm_agd` and `ndmm_agd_covs`.
```{r}
head(ndmm_agd)

ndmm_agd_covs
```

@Phillippo_survival analysed these data using multilevel network meta-regression (ML-NMR), and we recreate these analyses here.

# Study data
We consider adjustment for the following covariates:

 * Age
 * Sex
 * ISS stage, I-II vs. III
 * Response post-ASCT, complete or very good partial response vs. lesser response

The summary distributions of these characteristics in each study are as follows:
```{r}
bind_rows(
  summarise(ndmm_ipd,
            N = n(),
            age_mean = mean(age), age_sd = sd(age),
            iss_stage3 = mean(iss_stage3),
            response_cr_vgpr = mean(response_cr_vgpr),
            male = mean(male),
            .by = c(studyf, trtf)),
  transmute(ndmm_agd_covs,
            studyf, trtf,
            N = sample_size,
            age_mean, age_sd, iss_stage3, response_cr_vgpr, male)
) %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.double), ~round(., digits = 2)))
```

# Setup
## Preparing treatment classes
We start by setting up the network for the analysis.
Since we only have IPD on the placebo vs. lenalidomide comparison, and only one AgD study on the placebo vs. thalidomide comparison, we make the shared effect modifier assumption between the two active treatments in order to estimate the effect modifying treatment-covariate interactions for thalidomide [@TSD18;@methods_paper].
Since lenalidomide and thalidomide are both in the same class of treatments, this assumption may be reasonable.

To impose this assumption, we create a treatment class variable for active treatments vs. placebo.
```{r}
ndmm_ipd$trtclass <- case_match(ndmm_ipd$trtf,
                                "Pbo" ~ "Placebo",
                                c("Len", "Thal") ~ "Active")

ndmm_agd$trtclass <- case_match(ndmm_agd$trtf,
                                "Pbo" ~ "Placebo",
                                c("Len", "Thal") ~ "Active")
```


## Setting up the network
We then set up the network using the `set_ipd()`, `set_agd_surv()`, and `combine_network()` functions.
Since we have survival data in the form of event/censoring times and censoring indicators, we use the `Surv` argument to the `set_*()` functions to set up the outcome data using the usual `survival::Surv()` function.
The AgD are set up in a similar fashion to the IPD, except that we only have summary covariate information (in the data frame `ndmm_agd_covs`) which is included using the `covariates` argument.
The data frame passed to `covariates` must have matching study and treatment columns to the outcome data set (`ndmm_agd`), in this case `studyf` and `trtf` respectively, one row per arm, so that the covariate information can be matched to the corresponding arms in the outcome data.
The IPD and AgD are then combined into a single network using `combine_network()`.
```{r}
ndmm_net <- combine_network(
  set_ipd(ndmm_ipd,
          study = studyf,
          trt = trtf,
          trt_class = trtclass,
          Surv = Surv(eventtime / 12, status)),
  set_agd_surv(ndmm_agd,
               study = studyf,
               trt = trtf,
               trt_class = trtclass,
               Surv = Surv(eventtime / 12, status),
               covariates = ndmm_agd_covs)
)
```

## Adding numerical integration for ML-NMR
To perform ML-NMR, we need to create numerical integration points for the joint covariate distributions in each AgD study.
These are used to integrate (i.e. average) the individual-level model over the joint covariate distribution to form the aggregate-level model.
This is done using the `add_integration()` function, and for each covariate we specify the marginal distribution using the `distr()` function.
Since age is skewed, we use a gamma distribution for this covariate; the remaining covariates are all binary and so are given Bernoulli distributions.
This procedure also requires information on the correlations between covariates.
If known, these can be specified using the `cor` argument.
However, by default the weighted average correlations from the IPD studies will be used.
```{r}
ndmm_net <- add_integration(ndmm_net,
                            age = distr(qgamma, mean = age_mean, sd = age_sd),
                            iss_stage3 = distr(qbern, iss_stage3),
                            response_cr_vgpr = distr(qbern, response_cr_vgpr),
                            male = distr(qbern, male))

ndmm_net
```

## Network plot
We can plot the network diagram using the `plot()` method.
```{r ndmm-network}
plot(ndmm_net,
     weight_nodes = TRUE,
     weight_edges = TRUE,
     # Nudge treatment labels away from nodes
     nudge = 0.1,
     # Manual layout
     layout = data.frame(x = c(0, -1, 1),
                         y = c(-0.5, 0, 0))) +
  guides(edge_colour = guide_legend(override.aes = list(edge_width = 2))) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.direction = "vertical")
```

## Kaplan-Meier plots
We can produce Kaplan-Meier plots of the data from each study, with the aid of the `geom_km()` function.
```{r ndmm-km-data}
ggplot() +
  geom_km(ndmm_net) +
  facet_wrap(~.study) +
  labs(y = "Survival probability", x = "Time") +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 1)) +
  theme_multinma() +
  theme(legend.position = "top", legend.box.spacing = unit(0, "lines"))
```

The `transform` argument to `geom_km()` can be used to transform the Kaplan-Meier curves prior to plotting, for example `transform = "cloglog"` to assess proportional hazards with a log-log plot.

# ML-NMR models with M-spline baseline hazards
We fit a proportional hazards survival model with cubic M-splines on the baseline hazard [@Brilleman2020,@Phillippo_survival].
This allows the baseline hazard to flexibly follow any shape that the baseline hazard may take.
ML-NMR models are fit using the `nma()` function, and we specify that a M-spline baseline hazard should be used with `likelihood = "mspline"`.

Fitting spline models requires the user to specify the number and location of the knots.
By default, seven internal knots are used (`n_knots = 7`) which are placed at evenly spaced quantiles on the observed event times within each study.
Overfitting is avoided by the use of a random walk prior distribution on the (inverse softmax transformed) spline coefficients that penalises complexity and shrinks towards a constant baseline hazard [@Phillippo_survival]; in practice this means that the number of knots can be set to a sufficiently large number and left to shrink to a suitable level of complexity controlled by the standard deviation of the random walk.
The number of knots can be changed using the `n_knots` argument, or custom knot locations can be specified using the `knots` argument.
The `nma()` function will always place boundary knots at the earliest entry time into the study (0 with no delayed entry) and at the maximum event/censoring time.

By default, the `nma()` function will fit a cubic M-spline (`mspline_degree = 3`).
Piecewise-constant hazards (i.e. piecewise exponential hazards) are a special case with degree 0 splines, specified using `likelihood = "pexp"` (which is equivalent to `mspline_degree = 0`).

We specify a regression model using the `regression` argument which includes main effects of covariates (prognostic effects)  and treatment-covariate interactions (effect modifier interactions) for each covariate.
We place vague $\operatorname{N}(0, 100^2)$ priors on each of the parameters in the linear predictor.
We give the standard deviation for the random walk prior for the spline coefficients a $\operatorname{half-N}(0, 1^2)$ prior distribution.
We also set `QR = TRUE`, as using the QR decomposition can greatly increase sampling efficiency for regression models.

```{r}
ndmm_fit <- nma(ndmm_net,
                regression = ~(age + iss_stage3 + response_cr_vgpr + male)*.trt,
                likelihood = "mspline",
                prior_intercept = normal(0, 100),
                prior_trt = normal(0, 100),
                prior_reg = normal(0, 100),
                prior_aux = half_normal(1),
                QR = TRUE)

ndmm_fit
```

The details of the spline coefficients are not printed by default, but can be shown with `print()` or `summary()` using the `pars` option:
```{r}
summary(ndmm_fit, pars = "scoef")
```

## Ploting hazards
Let us look at the estimated hazard functions under this model.

By default, the `predict()` function with `type = "hazard"` will produce plots of the population-average marginal hazards (`level = "aggregate"`, which is the default).
These can then be plotted using the `plot()` function.
```{r ndmm-marginal-hazards}
plot(predict(ndmm_fit, type = "hazard", level = "aggregate"))
```

We can also look at the individual-level baseline hazards.
This is again possible using the `predict()` function, this time with `level = "individual"`.
Since we want to show the baseline hazard for the reference level of the covariates, we'll create a data frame to pass to `predict()` as `newdata`.
```{r}
refdat <- tibble(study = ndmm_net$studies,
                 age = ndmm_fit$xbar["age"],
                 iss_stage3 = 0,
                 response_cr_vgpr = 0,
                 male = 0)
```

Since we are providing a new data frame for prediction, we also need to provide the times to predict at and the distributions of the baseline (intercept) and auxiliary (spline coefficient) parameters.
We will predict at evenly spaced times between time 0 and the last event/censoring time in each study.
We specify a named list of the study names for both `baseline` and `aux`, to use the posterior distributions from each study for these parameters.
```{r}
# At evenly spaced times between the boundary knots
tdat <- purrr::imap_dfr(ndmm_fit$basis,
                        ~tibble(study = factor(.y, levels = ndmm_net$studies),
                                lower = attr(.x, "Boundary.knots")[1],
                                upper = attr(.x, "Boundary.knots")[2],
                                times = seq(lower, upper, length = 50)))

refdat <- left_join(refdat, tdat, by = "study")

studies <- as.list(setNames(nm = levels(ndmm_net$studies)))
```

Then we produce the predictions and plot:
```{r ndmm-baseline-hazards}
plot(predict(ndmm_fit, type = "hazard", level = "individual",
             newdata = refdat, study = study, times = times,
             baseline = studies, aux = studies))
```

# Assessing the proportional hazards assumption

We can relax and assess the proportional hazards (PH) assumption by allowing the spline coefficients to vary between treatment arms within each study.
This may be achieved using the `aux_by` argument, with `aux_by = c(.study, .trt)`.
Technically, `aux_by = .study` is always assumed in order to respect randomisation (analogous to stratifying the intercept terms in a NMA by study), and we could simply write `aux_by = .trt`; but we choose to make the stratification by study explicit in this instance.

```{r}
ndmm_fit_nph <- nma(ndmm_net,
                    regression = ~(age + iss_stage3 + response_cr_vgpr + male)*.trt,
                    likelihood = "mspline",
                    prior_intercept = normal(0, 100),
                    prior_trt = normal(0, 100),
                    prior_reg = normal(0, 100),
                    prior_aux = half_normal(1),
                    aux_by = c(.study, .trt),
                    QR = TRUE)

ndmm_fit_nph
```

We then compare model fit between models with and without PH using the LOOIC.
```{r}
(ndmm_fit_loo <- loo(ndmm_fit))
(ndmm_fit_nph_loo <- loo(ndmm_fit_nph))

# Compare to PH model
loo_compare(ndmm_fit_loo, ndmm_fit_nph_loo)
```
The overall fit for the proportional hazards model is better.

We should check that no single study has a better fit with the non-PH model, in case an improved fit in one study has been masked by the increased complexity in others.
```{r}
studies_all <- c(ndmm_ipd$study, ndmm_agd$study)
cbind(
  PH = by(ndmm_fit_loo$pointwise[, "looic"], studies_all, sum),
  `non-PH` = by(ndmm_fit_nph_loo$pointwise[, "looic"], studies_all, sum)
)
```
The LOOIC is similar or lower for the proportional hazards model compared to the non-proportional hazards model in all studies.
Based on LOOIC alone, there is no evidence to suggest that the proportional hazards assumption is invalid here.
Later, visual inspection of the estimated survival curves also suggests that the model is a good fit to the data.

Stratifying the baseline hazards by treatment arm (as well as by study) results in a model that cannot produce absolute predictions for treatments in populations where they have not already been observed; e.g. an estimated survival curve for thalidomide can only be produced in the Morgan2012 study population (the only study with a thalidomide arm), and a survival curve for lenalidomide cannot be produced in this population.
Instead, if the proportional hazards assumption is deemed inappropriate, we might consider instead modelling departures from proportional hazards using the `aux_regression` argument to `nma()` which places a model on the (inverse softmax transformed) spline coefficients, or on the shape parameters in a parametric model.
For example, we can allow the baseline hazard to vary smoothly by treatment arm (`aux_regression = ~.trt`) and/or by other covariates (e.g. `aux_regression = ~.trt + iss_stage3`).
This further relaxes the proportional hazards assumption (which is already relaxed by the inclusion of patient-level covariates), whilst still allowing predictions to be produced on every treatment in any population of interest.

# Comparison to unadjusted NMA
For comparison, we also fit NMA models without any covariate adjustment, both with and without the proportional hazards assumption.
```{r}
ndmm_fit_nma <- nma(ndmm_net,
                    likelihood = "mspline",
                    prior_intercept = normal(0, 100),
                    prior_trt = normal(0, 100),
                    prior_aux = half_normal(1))

ndmm_fit_nma

ndmm_fit_nma_nph <- nma(ndmm_net,
                        likelihood = "mspline",
                        prior_intercept = normal(0, 100),
                        prior_trt = normal(0, 100),
                        prior_aux = half_normal(1),
                        aux_by = c(.study, .trt))

ndmm_fit_nma_nph
```

Again, we compare the model fit using the LOOIC, both overall and within each study.
```{r}
# Compare overall model fit
(ndmm_fit_nma_loo <- loo(ndmm_fit_nma))

(ndmm_fit_nma_nph_loo <- loo(ndmm_fit_nma_nph))

loo_compare(ndmm_fit_nma_loo, ndmm_fit_nma_nph_loo)

# Compare model fit by study
cbind(
  PH = by(ndmm_fit_nma_loo$pointwise[, "looic"], studies_all, sum),
  `non-PH` = by(ndmm_fit_nma_nph_loo$pointwise[, "looic"], studies_all, sum)
)
```
Whilst there is little difference in overall model fit, the non-PH model is preferred in the Jackson2019 study with a substantially lower LOOIC.
Including the covariates in the ML-NMR model is sufficient to remove this PH violation, even though the covariates are fixed and not time-varying, and the ML-NMR model is a much better fit overall.

> **Note:** This test is likely to have low power, and is not a substitute for the usual inspection of proportional hazards prior to analysis. Using `transform = "cloglog"` in `geom_km()` to produce log-log plots is one option to assess proportionality.

# Producing population-average estimates
We now produce population-average estimates for several different quantities of interest.
The usual array of posterior summary functions is available, including `relative_effects()`, `predict()`, `marginal_effects()`, `posterior_ranks()` and `posterior_rank_probs()`.
The `predict()` function in particular has numerous options when working with survival models, selected using the `type` argument:

* `"survival"` for survival probabilities
* `"hazard"` for hazards
* `"cumhaz"` for cumulative hazards
* `"rmst"` for restricted mean survival times
* `"mean"` for mean survival times (equivalent to `type = "rmst"` with `time = Inf`)
* `"quantile"` for quantiles of the survival time distribution
* `"median"` for median survival times (equivalent to `type = "quantile"` with `quantiles = 0.5`)
* `"link"` for the linear predictor

When producing population-average predictions (which is the default with `level = "aggregate"`), each of these quantities corresponds to the population-average marginal survival function; see `?predict.stan_nma` for more details.
The `marginal_effects()` function may be used to form population-average marginal treatment effects from any of the above population-average predictions.

## Population-average survival probabilities
To produce population-average survival curves we use the `predict()` function with `type = "survival"`.
These are marginal or standardised survival curves.
We also overlay the unadjusted Kaplan-Meier curves from the data using the `geom_km()` helper function.
```{r ndmm-survival}
plot(predict(ndmm_fit, type = "survival")) +
  geom_km(ndmm_net) +
  theme(legend.position = "top", legend.box.spacing = unit(0, "lines"))
```

Whilst the adjusted and unadjusted curves are not exactly comparable (although these are both marginal survival estimates, the adjusted curves account for differences in covariate distributions between arms and are relevant to the overall population of each study), the estimated survival curves are a good fit to the data.
The baseline imbalance in sex in Palumbo2014 study has been accounted for in the model, which explains the slight differences against the Kaplan-Meier curves there.

## Population-average median survival times
The `predict()` function can produce a range of other absolute effect summaries, for example population-average median survival times:
```{r ndmm-median-survival}
(medsurv <- predict(ndmm_fit, type = "median"))

plot(medsurv)
```

## Population-average conditional log hazard ratios
Relative effects are produced using the `relative_effects()` function.
With a ML-NMR model (or an IPD meta-regression), these are population-average conditional log hazard ratios (or log survival time ratios for AFT models).
```{r ndmm-loghr}
(loghr <- relative_effects(ndmm_fit, all_contrasts = TRUE))

plot(loghr)
```

## Population-average marginal hazard ratios
The `marginal_effects()` function produces population-average marginal relative effects, which are formed from the marginal absolute predictions produced by `predict()`.
For example, we can produce population-average marginal hazard ratios:
```{r ndmm-marginal-hr}
plot(marginal_effects(ndmm_fit, type = "hazard", mtype = "ratio")) +
  theme(legend.position = "top", legend.box.spacing = unit(0, "lines"))
```
These are time-varying and non-proportional because the model includes covariate effects, even though the covariates were only measured at baseline and were not themselves time-varying.
