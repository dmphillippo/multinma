\usage{
make_knots(
  network,
  n_knots = 7,
  type = c("quantile", "quantile_common", "quantile_lumped", "quantile_longest", "equal",
    "equal_common")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{network}{A network object, containing survival outcomes}

\item{n_knots}{Non-negative integer giving the number of internal knots
(default \code{7})}

\item{type}{String specifying the knot location algorithm to use (see
details). The default used by \code{\link[=nma]{nma()}} is \code{"quantile"}, except when a
regression model is specified (using \code{aux_regression}) in which case the
default is \code{"quantile_common"}.}
}
\value{
A named list of vectors giving the knot locations in each study.
}
\description{
Several different algorithms are provided to calculate knot locations for
M-spline baseline hazard models. This function is called internally within
the \code{\link[=nma]{nma()}} function, but may be called directly by the user for more
control.
}
\details{
The \code{type} argument can be used to choose between different
algorithms for placing the knots:

\describe{
\item{\code{"quantile"}}{Creates separate knot locations for each study,
internal knots are placed at evenly-spaced quantiles of the observed event
times within each study.}
\item{\code{"quantile_lumped"}}{Creates a common set of knots for all studies,
calculated as evenly-spaced quantiles of the observed event times from all
studies lumped together.}
\item{\code{"quantile_common"}}{Creates a common set of knots for all studies,
taking quantiles of the quantiles of the observed event times within each
study. This often seems to result in a more even knot spacing than
\code{"quantile_lumped"}, particularly when follow-up is uneven across studies,
and may handle differing behaviour in the baseline hazard across studies
better than \code{"quantile_longest"}.}
\item{\code{"quantile_longest"}}{Creates a common set of knots for all studies,
using evenly-spaced quantiles of the observed event times in the longest
study.}
\item{\code{"equal"}}{Creates separate knot locations for each study, at
evenly-spaced times between the boundary knots in each study.}
\item{\code{"equal_common"}}{Creates a common set of knots for all studies, at
evenly-spaced times between the earliest entry time and last
event/censoring time in the network.}
}

Boundary knots are calculated as follows:
\itemize{
\item For separate knot locations in each study, boundary knots are placed at the
earliest entry time and last event/censoring time in each study.
\item For a common set of knots across all studies, boundary knots are placed at
the earliest entry time and last event/censoring time across all studies.
}

Models with regression on the spline coefficients (i.e. with \code{aux_regression}
specified) require a common set of knots across all studies.

Provided that a sufficient number of knots are used, model fit should be
largely unaffected by the knot locations. However, sampling difficulties can
sometimes occur if knot placement is poor, for example if a knot is placed
just before the last follow-up time in a study.
