  x,
  y,
  ...,
  show_uncertainty = TRUE,
  stat = "pointinterval",
  orientation = c("vertical", "horizontal", "x", "y")

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{nma_dic} object}

\item{y}{(Optional) A second \code{nma_dic} object, to produce "dev-dev" plots for
model comparison.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed on to other methods}

\item{show_uncertainty}{Logical, show uncertainty with a \code{ggdist} plot
stat? Default \code{TRUE}.}

\item{stat}{Character string specifying the \code{ggdist} plot stat to use if
\code{show_uncertainty = TRUE}, default \code{"pointinterval"}. If \code{y} is provided,
currently only \code{"pointinterval"} is supported.}

\item{orientation}{Whether the \code{ggdist} geom is drawn horizontally
(\code{"horizontal"}) or vertically (\code{"vertical"}). Only used for residual
deviance plots, default \code{"vertical"}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object.

\description{
The \code{plot()} method for \link{nma_dic} objects produced by \code{\link[=dic]{dic()}} produces
several useful diagnostic plots for checking model fit and model comparison.
Further detail on these plots and their interpretation is given by
\insertCite{TSD2;textual}{multinma}.
}
\details{
When a single \code{nma_dic} object is given, a plot of the residual
deviance contribution for each data point is produced. For a good fitting
model, each data point is expected to have a residual deviance of 1; larger
values indicate data points that are fit poorly by the model.

When two \code{nma_dic} objects are given, a "dev-dev" plot comparing the
residual deviance contributions under each model is produced. Data points
with residual deviance contributions lying on the line of equality are fit
equally well under either model. Data points lying below the line of
equality indicate better fit under the second model (\code{y}); conversely, data
points lying above the line of equality indicate better fit under the first
model (\code{x}). A common use case is to compare a standard consistency model
(fitted using \code{\link[=nma]{nma()}} with \code{consistency = "consistency"}) with an unrelated
mean effects (UME) inconsistency model (fitted using \code{\link[=nma]{nma()}} with
\code{consistency = "ume"}), to check for potential inconsistency.

See \insertCite{TSD2;textual}{multinma} for further details.
