\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{stan_nma} object created by \code{\link[=nma]{nma()}}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (not used).}

\item{baseline}{An optional \code{\link[=distr]{distr()}} distribution for the baseline response
(i.e. intercept) on the linear predictor scale, about which to produce
absolute effects. For example, in a model with a logit link, this would be
a distribution for the baseline log odds of an event. If \code{NULL},
predictions are produced using the baseline response for each study in the
network with IPD or arm-based AgD.}

\item{newdata}{Only required if a regression model is fitted and \code{baseline}
is specified. A data frame of covariate details, for which to produce
predictions. Column names must match variables in the regression model.

If \code{type = "aggregate"} this should either be a data frame with integration
points as produced by \code{\link[=add_integration]{add_integration()}} (one row per study), or a data
frame with individual covariate values (one row per individual) which are
summarised over.

If \code{type = "individual"} this should be a data frame of individual
covariate values, one row per individual.

If \code{NULL}, predictions are produced for all studies with IPD and/or
arm-based AgD in the network, depending on the value of \code{type}.}

\item{study}{Column of \code{newdata} which specifies study names or IDs. When not
specified: if \code{newdata} contains integration points produced by
\code{\link[=add_integration]{add_integration()}}, studies will be labelled sequentially by row;
otherwise data will be assumed to come from a single study.}

\item{trt_ref}{Treatment to which the \code{baseline} response distribution
refers, if \code{baseline} is specified. By default, the baseline response
distribution will refer to the network reference treatment. Coerced to
character string.}

\item{type}{Whether to produce predictions on the \code{"link"} scale (the
default, e.g. log odds) or \code{"response"} scale (e.g. probabilities).}

\item{level}{The level at which predictions are produced, either
\code{"aggregate"} (the default), or \code{"individual"}. If \code{baseline} is not
specified, predictions are produced for all IPD studies in the network if
\code{type} is \code{"individual"} or \code{"aggregate"}, and for all arm-based AgD
studies in the network if \code{type} is \code{"aggregate"}.}

\item{probs}{Numeric vector of quantiles of interest to present in computed
summary, default \code{c(0.025, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.975)}}

\item{summary}{Logical, calculate posterior summaries? Default \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A \link{nma_summary} object if \code{summary = TRUE}, otherwise a list
containing a 3D MCMC array of samples and (for regression models) a data
frame of study information.
}
\description{
Obtain predictions of absolute effects from NMA models fitted with \code{\link[=nma]{nma()}}.
For example, if a model is fitted to binary data with a logit link, predicted
outcome probabilities or log odds can be produced.
